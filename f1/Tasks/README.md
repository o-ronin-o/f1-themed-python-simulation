# 🏎️ F1 Strategy Racing Game (Python)

## 🚀 Overview
This is a futuristic Formula 1 turn-based racing simulation written in Python. Two iconic drivers — Max Verstappen and Hassan Mostafa — battle it out using strategic offensive and defensive racing maneuvers. The game uses object-oriented design principles and includes voice-controlled moves via the Groq Speech-to-Text API.

- Max uses manual input (keyboard)
- Hassan uses **voice commands** to select tactics
- Each move consumes fuel and affects tire health
- The race ends when one player's tire health hits 0 or both are out of fuel

## 🎯 Features
- Turn-based gameplay with live input
- Modular design using:
  - Strategy Design Pattern for tactics
  - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Speech recognition with Groq's Whisper model (via `groq` API)
- Clean class structure (Driver, Tactics, Race, etc.)
